This bot is a bot for telegrams and is meant to be a collection of phrases/images for programmers, like a spacobot but for programmers.

## Features

Obscure bot token in source code for github users (avoid hot head problems).
Added possibility to send broadcast messages with the bot through idChat (not violet privacy GDPR, because id chat is not a sensitive data)
Unresolved problem with the log, only the ERROR level works.
README.MG update.
